## Sprint 1 — Tier 1 stability + Tier 2 discoverability

### ✅ T1.2 — Confirmation dialog timeout (30s auto-cancel)

- `src/Axon/AxonProvider.tsx` — added `CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_MS` + `timeoutId` on
  the `ConfirmRequest` shape; `requestConfirmation` now schedules an
  auto-cancel that resolves the dialog as `false` and drops a system note
  if the operator never answers. `answerConfirmation` clears the timer
  when a real answer arrives.

### ✅ T1.3 — Persistable undo stack (descriptor + handler registry)

- `src/Axon/engine/undoStack.ts` — rewrote to support two flavors of
  undo:
    - Closure-style (session-scoped, unchanged contract)
    - Descriptor-style: `{ kind, payload }` resolved via a handler
      registered with `registerUndoHandler`. These entries round-trip
      through localStorage under the `axon:undoStack:v1` key.
  Added `resolveUndo()` so callers don't need to know which flavor
  they're holding. Added `hydrateUndoStack()` to restore on mount.
- `src/Axon/types.ts` — relaxed `ActionContext.pushUndo` signature to
  accept either `undo` or `descriptor` (optional, at least one required
  in practice).
- `src/Axon/actions/undo.ts`, `src/Axon/actions/trust.ts` — swapped
  `entry.undo()` for `resolveUndo(entry)()` with a clean "stale entry"
  fallback message if the handler isn't registered.
- `src/Axon/actions/tasks.ts` — migrated all 3 undo pushes (create /
  update-status / delete) to descriptor-style with three registered
  handlers: `task.delete-created`, `task.restore-status`,
  `task.restore-deleted`. Demonstrates the pattern for other callers to
  follow.
- `src/Axon/AxonProvider.tsx` — calls `hydrateUndoStack()` once on mount.

### ✅ T2.1 — Inject capabilities roster into Claude preamble

- `src/Axon/engine/brain.ts` — new `buildCapabilitiesBlock()` emits a
  `<capabilities>` tag listing every registered action name, plus a
  nudge to Claude to group + phrase them conversationally when the
  operator asks "what can you do". Appended to every preamble.

### ✅ T2.2 — Voice-friendly `help` action

- `src/Axon/actions/help.ts` (new) — dedicated `help` action that
  groups registered action names by topic (navigation, tasks, meetings,
  chat, memory, registry, automations, briefings, admin, trust) and
  returns a conversational human-friendly summary instead of a raw
  list. Triggered by "help", "what can you do", "capabilities", etc.
- `src/Axon/actions/index.ts` — wired `registerHelpActions()` into the
  central registration list.

### Housekeeping

- `src/MyComponents/Beginning/conceptIdea.tsx` — re-saved the
  dispatcher in clean UTF-8 (git had started reporting it as binary due
  to a stray byte). No behavioral change — still re-exports
  `EditorialAuth`.
- `docs/AXON_BACKLOG.md` (new) — the full backlog driving this work.
- `docs/AXON_PROGRESS.md` (this file) — running log of shipped work.

### Shipped

Commit `52c12bb` — "feat(axon): persistable undo, confirm timeout, help action, capabilities roster"

## Sprint 2 — core features filled in

### ✅ T3.5 — Announcements actually broadcast now

- `src/Axon/actions/announcements.ts` — `confirm_announcement` now
  inserts into `cwa_chat` with a `📢 Announcement · <audience>` prefix
  so it reads as a company-wide post in the existing #General channel.
  Also fires the local Tauri notification for immediate operator
  feedback. Registered a new descriptor-style undo handler
  `announcement.delete-posted` that removes the row by id, so "undo
  that" retracts a broadcast cleanly (even after reload).

### ✅ T3.6 — Recurring meetings

- `src/Axon/actions/meetings.ts` — `create_meeting` now accepts
  `recurrence` (daily / weekly / biweekly / monthly), plus `endDate`
  or `occurrences` to bound the series. Single-call inserts up to 52
  rows in one batch. Registered `meeting.delete-batch` undo handler
  that takes the full id array — "undo that" cancels the entire
  series in one stroke.

### ✅ T4.5 — Paginated data queries

- `src/Axon/actions/tasks.ts` — `list_tasks` now accepts `offset` and
  returns a `nextOffset` cursor. Limit clamped to `[1, 200]`. The
  brain can chain "next 25" without re-deriving the arithmetic.
- `src/Axon/actions/cwa_registry.ts` — `search_registry` got the same
  treatment: `limit` + `offset` inputs, `nextOffset` output, 100-row
  cap. Prevents pathological full-table scans.

### ✅ T3.1 — Persistent automations

- `src/Axon/actions/automations.ts` — all mutations now mirror to
  localStorage (`axon:automations:v1`). `hydrateAutomations()` runs
  the moment `_bindAutomationExecutor` lands an executor; it restores
  recurring automations by restarting the interval, and reminders by
  computing the remaining delay. Reminders whose fire time has passed
  are silently dropped (missing a late reminder beats a surprise
  burst of them on reload).

### Shipped

Commit `5585810` — "feat(axon): announcements broadcast, recurring meetings, pagination, persistent automations"

## Sprint 3 — robustness + the big feature (call mode)

### ✅ T1.4 — Serial dispatch queue

- `src/Axon/AxonProvider.tsx` — `submitCommand` is now a thin wrapper
  that chains off an `inFlightRef` promise. Rapid-fire triggers (voice
  intent + automation fire + keyboard shortcut landing at the same
  time) now execute one-at-a-time instead of racing each other's
  conversation history / activity log / pending-confirm state.

### ✅ T5.3 — CALL MODE (the big ticket item)

- `src/Axon/types.ts` — `AxonContextValue` gained `callMode: boolean`
  and `setCallMode(on: boolean)`. `ActionContext` gained `setCallMode?`
  so actions can toggle it themselves.
- `src/Axon/AxonProvider.tsx` — new `callMode` state + `callModeRef`
  for use inside stale-closure callbacks. The TTS `onEnd` handler now
  arms the recognizer whenever `callModeRef.current` is true (not just
  when Axon's line ended with a question). Exposed through the context
  value + plugged into the ActionContext.
- `src/Axon/actions/call.ts` (new) — `start_call` and `end_call`
  actions. Trigger phrases: "start a call" / "call me" / "let's chat"
  / "conversation mode" to engage; "hang up" / "end call" / "that's
  all for now" to disengage.
- `src/Axon/actions/index.ts` — registered both call-mode actions.
- `src/Axon/ui/CommandPanel.tsx` — added a "📞 Call" / "📞 On Call"
  toggle button in the header that reflects + flips callMode. Turns
  red when active.

Under the hood it's a tiny change — just "arm the mic after every
reply instead of only after questions." The UX payoff is huge: Axon
now feels like a phone conversation, not a command-shell prompt.

### Shipped

Commit `b39a2ea` — "feat(axon): call mode + serial dispatch queue"

## Sprint 4 — Outbound reach + multi-step workflows + external data

> Triggered by Axon's own self-audit: "outbound reach is the biggest
> gap." This sprint closes the outbound family + the data-ingestion
> family + multi-step workflows in a single push.

### ✅ T7.9 — Credentials store

- `src/Axon/engine/credentials.ts` (new) — keyed localStorage backing
  for webhook URLs, API tokens, secrets. Convention: `<kind>:<label>`.
- `src/Axon/actions/credentials.ts` (new) — `set_credential`,
  `forget_credential`, `list_credentials` actions. Forget pushes a
  descriptor-style undo so "undo that" restores the value. Audit log
  captures the key but never the secret.

### ✅ T7.1-T7.3 — Outbound integrations

- `src/Axon/actions/outbound.ts` (new) — three actions, all gated by
  credential lookups (returns a "set up first" message if missing):
    - `send_webhook` — generic POST/PUT to a stored URL. Foundation
      for everything else.
    - `send_discord_message` — wraps the webhook primitive with
      Discord's payload shape (`content` + optional `username`).
    - `create_github_issue` — POSTs to api.github.com/repos/{o}/{r}/issues
      with a Bearer PAT (default credential key `github:pat`).
      Returns the issue number + URL on success.

### ✅ T7.5-T7.6 — External data ingestion

- `src/Axon/actions/ingest.ts` (new):
    - `fetch_url` — generic HTTPS GET. Returns text body truncated to
      8KB to keep the LLM context healthy. Optional `bearerKey`
      threads a credential through as `Authorization: Bearer …`.
    - `read_github_pr` — calls api.github.com/.../pulls/{n} and
      returns title, state (open/closed/merged), author, body summary,
      and diff stats. Optional PAT for higher rate limits / private
      repos.

### ✅ T3.3 — chain_commands (multi-step workflows)

- `src/Axon/engine/commandExecutor.ts` (new) — extracted shared
  binding for "submit a natural-language command back to AXON's
  brain". The provider binds it once on mount; both the existing
  automation executor and the new chain_commands hook off this.
- `src/Axon/actions/workflows.ts` (new) — `chain_commands` action
  takes `{ description, commands[], stopOnError? }` and runs each
  command sequentially through the brain pipeline (so each step gets
  full context, confirmations, undo). Capped at 12 steps with a 350ms
  pause between fires to avoid hammering Anthropic. `stopOnError`
  defaults to true.
- `src/Axon/AxonProvider.tsx` — calls `bindCommandExecutor` alongside
  `_bindAutomationExecutor` so both consumers see the same handler.
